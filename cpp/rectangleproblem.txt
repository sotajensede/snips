So I've learned how to make little animations and whatnot
by giving x,y coordinates to the program and it prints
whatever on the screen there. So then I wanted to figure
out how to make a "#" move around in a rectangle and this
is what it looks like. Brain is turning into a vaccuum.

if(cx<(x/2-1)+33 && cy==(y/2-1))
	cx++;
else if(cx==(x/2-1)+33)
	cy++;
if(cx>(x/2-1) && cy==(y/2+1))
	cx--;
else if(cx==(x/2-1))
	cy--;

This runs through a loop, checks each of these lines
and executes the indented statement if the "if" is true. 
The only tricky thing is that as your Y axis goes up, you're actually moving down the screen.
So basically:

Say,

x=0
y=0

Step 1:

"as long as x is less than 33 and y is 0, add 1 to x"

so the cursor moves to the right until it's at column 33

Step 2:

"otherwise, if x is 33, add 1 to y"

when it gets to column 33, go down

Step 3:

"if x is greater than 0 and y is 3 subtract 1 from x"

when you get 3 rows down, go left until x is 0 again

Step 4:

"otherwise, if x is 0, subtract 1 from y"

when x gets back to 0 go up again

Repeat infinitely.

But for some reason, the "#" is skipping the bottom right corner
and that's what I'm trying to fix right now. lol.
