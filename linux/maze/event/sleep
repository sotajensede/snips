Road worn, you find a place off the trail where
you drift into sleep. You have dreams of great 
triumph and glory. Most importantly, of rest and of
peace away from the harsh wilderness. It is while
in one such comforting dream that you awake to a 
horrendous pain in your leg, realising you're the
prey of some predator monster in this land. As 
you are devoured, your last thoughts are of the 
home you will never return to.
